"Calculator Plugin for OpenCPN by SaltyPaws aka Walbert Schulpen/Updated by "
"Mike Rossiter(Rasbats)\n"
"=======================================\n"
"\n"
"This is a light weight yet powerful calculator plugin for OpenCPN. Would you "
"like to know your hull speed? \n"
"\n"
"Key features are:\n"
"* Storing results in variables\n"
"* Shows historic calculations\n"
"* Full complement of nautical functions\n"
"* Screen footprint can be optimised & minimised as required\n"
"\n"
"Adding formulas is easy. If your favorite nautical equation is missing, "
"please let me know your equation via flyspray, and I will add it.\n"
"\n"
"Many formulas are based on U.S. units. Formulas use a 'base' unit, for "
"example US Gallons per Minute. Conversion factors are used to display the "
"result in other units. Using other units the result may not be exactly as "
"expected. For example \"Convert Flowrate\": 10 m3/s converts to "
"599999.999365987 liter per minute, not 600000 exactly, using the 'precise' "
"accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"Help\n"
"=========\n"
"Type help in the calculator to get these instructions.\n"
"\n"
"Examples of expression that work in the calculator are: (comments are in "
"brackets, some results depend on other example calculations):\n"
